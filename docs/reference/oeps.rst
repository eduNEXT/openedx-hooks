Open edX Proposals
==================

Here we list the Open edX proposals used throughout the project, that will help
you understand the major decisions made during the library's design.

- The `Hooks extension framework (OEP-50)`_ which specifies its motivation,
implementation details, rationale, performance considerations, general use
cases and more. The goal of the OEP-50 is give the extensions' developer a
glance on the framework implementation and design.

- The `Asynchronous Server Event Message Format (OEP-41)`_, which
specifies the header information format sent by the events. For a detailed description
on the impact of the OEP-41, please refer to the Events Payload ADR.
