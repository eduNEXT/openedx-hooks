Using Open edX Events within edx-platform
=========================================

How to use
----------

Using openedx-events in your code is very straight forward. We can consider the
two possible cases, sending or receiving an event.


Receiving events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is one of the most common use cases for plugins. The edx-platform will send
and event and you want to react to it in your plugin.

For this you need to:

1. Include openedx-events in your dependencies.
2. Connect your receiver functions to the signals being sent.

Connecting signals can be done using regular django syntax:

.. code-block:: python

    from openedx_events.learning.signals import STUDENT_REGISTRATION_COMPLETED

    @receiver(STUDENT_REGISTRATION_COMPLETED)
    def your_receiver_function(**kwargs):
        # your implementation here


Or at the apps.py

.. code-block:: python

    {
        "signals_config": {
            "lms.djangoapp": {
                "relative_path": "your_module_name",
                "receivers": [
                    {
                        "receiver_func_name": "your_receiver_function",
                        "signal_path": "openedx_events.learning.signals.STUDENT_REGISTRATION_COMPLETED",
                    },
                ],
            }
        }
    }


In case you are listening to an event in the edx-platform repo, you can directly
use the django syntax since the apps.py method will not be available without the
plugin.


Sending events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sending events requires you to import both the event definition as well as the
attr data classes that encapsulate the event data.

.. code-block:: python

    from openedx_events.learning.data import UserData, UserPersonalData
    from openedx_events.learning.signals import STUDENT_REGISTRATION_COMPLETED

    STUDENT_REGISTRATION_COMPLETED.send_event(
        user=UserData(
            pii=UserPersonalData(
                username=user.username,
                email=user.email,
                name=user.profile.name,
            ),
            id=user.id,
            is_active=user.is_active,
        ),
    )

You can do this both from the edx-platform code as well as from an openedx
plugin.


Testing events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Testing your code in CI, specially for plugins is now possible without having to
import the complete edx-platform as a dependency.

To test your functions you need to include the openedx-events library in your
testing dependencies and make the signal connection in your test case.

.. code-block:: python

    from openedx_events.learning.signals import STUDENT_REGISTRATION_COMPLETED

    def test_your_receiver(self):
        STUDENT_REGISTRATION_COMPLETED.connect(your_function)
        STUDENT_REGISTRATION_COMPLETED.send_event(
            user=UserData(
                pii=UserPersonalData(
                    username='test_username',
                    email='test_email@example.com',
                    name='test_name',
                ),
                id=1,
                is_active=True,
            ),
        )

        # run your assertions


Changes in the openedx-events library that are not compatible with your code
should break this kind of test in CI and let you know you need to upgrade your
code.
